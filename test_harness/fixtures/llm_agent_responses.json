          "content": "Based on the documentation, Marvin has several key architectural decisions:\n\n1. **Browser Extension First**: Marvin is developed as a browser extension from the start rather than beginning with a standalone application. This provides direct access to browser state and behavior which is crucial for core functionality.\n\n2. **Neo4j as Knowledge Graph Backend**: Marvin uses Neo4j as the primary database for storing and managing the knowledge graph. This provides a native graph database optimized for relationship queries.\n\n3. **LLM Provider Abstraction**: Marvin implements a provider-agnostic abstraction layer for LLM integration, supporting both local and cloud-based models.\n\n4. **Security Model**: Security features are implemented as part of Phase 3, with architecture supporting security from the start.\n\n5. **Browser Compatibility**: Initial focus is on Chrome, with architecture supporting cross-browser deployment later.\n\n6. **Local-First Architecture**: The system is designed to operate fully locally with optional cloud integration, prioritizing privacy protection."
