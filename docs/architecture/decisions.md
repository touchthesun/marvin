# Architectural Decisions

## Overview
This document records the key architectural decisions made in the Marvin project and their rationales. These decisions shape the fundamental structure and capabilities of the system.

## Browser Extension First
**Decision**: Develop Marvin as a browser extension from the start rather than beginning with a standalone application.

**Rationale**:
- Direct access to browser state and behavior is crucial for core functionality
- Avoiding future migration complexity from standalone to extension
- Better user experience through seamless browser integration
- Access to browser APIs for bookmarks, tabs, and navigation
- Reduced need for workarounds to access browser state

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex initial development
- Browser-specific considerations from day one
- Need for separate extensions per browser
- More complex testing environment

## Neo4j as Knowledge Graph Backend
**Decision**: Use Neo4j as the primary database for storing and managing the knowledge graph.

**Rationale**:
- Native graph database optimized for relationship queries
- Mature, well-documented system with strong community support
- Rich query language (Cypher) for complex relationship traversal
- Built-in support for graph algorithms and analytics
- Capable of running locally, supporting our privacy-first principle

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional system dependency for users
- Learning curve for Cypher query language
- Resource requirements for local deployment

## LLM Provider Abstraction
**Decision**: Implement a provider-agnostic abstraction layer for LLM integration.

**Rationale**:
- Support for both local and cloud-based models
- Privacy concerns require option for local-only operation
- Rapid evolution of LLM technology requires flexibility
- Different users may have different provider preferences
- Cost management through provider selection

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional complexity in implementation
- Potential limitations in provider-specific features
- Need to maintain multiple provider integrations

## Security Model
**Decision**: Implement security features as part of Phase 3, with architecture supporting security from the start.

**Rationale**:
- Early phases focus on core functionality validation
- Security implementation requires stable core architecture
- Phase 3 timing allows for comprehensive security implementation
- Architecture designed with security hooks from beginning

**Trade-offs**:
- Initial versions have basic security
- Need for potential refactoring for security features
- Limited initial deployment scope

## Browser Compatibility
**Decision**: Focus initially on Chrome, with architecture supporting cross-browser deployment.

**Rationale**:
- Chrome has largest market share
- Well-documented extension APIs
- Strong developer tools
- Clear migration path to other browsers
- Established patterns for cross-browser support

**Trade-offs**:
- Initial limitation to Chrome users
- Need for browser-specific adaptations later
- Potential feature limitations in other browsers

## Local-First Architecture
**Decision**: Design system to operate fully locally with optional cloud integration.

**Rationale**:
- Privacy protection for user data
- Reduced dependency on external services
- Support for sensitive use cases
- User control over their data
- Compliance with privacy regulations

**Trade-offs**:
- Increased local resource requirements
- More complex deployment
- Limited collaborative features initially
- Need for local backup solutions

## Future Considerations
- Cross-browser synchronization strategies
- Collaborative feature implementation
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Mobile browser support


## Dependency Injection Decision

Context: 
The content analysis system initially used a singleton pattern for context management, which presented several challenges as the system grew in complexity.

### Pros of Dependency Injection

 - Explicit Dependencies

Dependencies are clearly visible in constructor signatures
Makes code more maintainable and easier to understand
Prevents hidden coupling between components


 - Improved Testing

Each test can use its own isolated context
Easy to mock dependencies
No need to manage global state between tests
Can test different implementations easily


 - Better Flexibility

Easy to swap implementations
Supports different contexts for different environments
Can implement different backends without changing client code


 - Better Concurrency Support

No shared global state
Each instance has its own isolated context
Reduces risk of race conditions


 - Clearer Resource Management

Resources tied to specific instances
Clear lifecycle management
Better control over cleanup



### Cons of Dependency Injection

 - Increased Initial Complexity

More setup code required
Need to manage dependency graph
More initial boilerplate


 - Configuration Management

Need to manage configuration at composition root
More complex startup process
Need to carefully manage dependency order


 - Learning Curve

Team needs to understand DI patterns
May be unfamiliar to some developers
Requires more disciplined coding approach



### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation**

Create base types and interfaces

AbstractBaseClasses for major components
Type definitions
Configuration classes


Implement context management

Remove singleton pattern
Create context hierarchy
Implement different context types



**Phase 2: Component Refactoring**

Update processor components

Refactor for DI
Add factory classes
Update tests


Update batch processing

Add context management
Implement resource tracking
Update async handling



**Phase 3: Integration**

Create factory system

Main factory class
Configuration management
Component lifecycle


Update pipeline

New orchestration
Error handling
Monitoring
