## Project Overview

### Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: All data storage and processing capable of running locally
- **Model Agnostic**: Support for both local and cloud-based LLM providers
- **Browser Extension First**: Built as a browser extension from the ground up
- **Active Assistant**: Performs autonomous actions on user's behalf

### Current Status
Marvin is currently in early development. The project is following a phased approach:

- **Phase 0**: Documentation and Planning [done]
- **Phase 1**: Core Browser Extension MVP [currently in progress]
- **Phase 2**: Core Assistant Features
- **Phase 3**: Security & Advanced Features
- **Phase 4**: Production Readiness
