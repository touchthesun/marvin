## Marvin: Your LLM-Powered Personal Librarian

Marvin emerged from a simple yet deeply personal need: to combat the "out of sight, out of mind" nature of digital bookmarking. This project is about offering a tool to make the digital environment a more manageable place.

I spend a lot of time researching things on the internet. Every article, blog post, and video saved as a bookmark represents a moment of discovery and learning. But now my bookmarks folder is full of things I don't remember saving, without context or connection, and I don't know how to reconstruct what I was thinking when I saved something. This means that even though I have hundreds of saved bookmarks, and my 87 emotional support chrome tabs, I have only the most tenuous access to any of that information.

Marvin is a librarian for your browsing data. Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), it transforms your bookmarks and open tabs from hidden, cluttered lists into an engaging, accessible library. With Marvin, your digital finds are not just remembered but also become integral parts of your continuous learning journey.

## Project Status
Currently, Marvin is in its early development stages. We're actively testing and improving its features. Stay tuned for updates.
